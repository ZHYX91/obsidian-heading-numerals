# Runtime acceptance checklist

This is a non-authoritative execution checklist. The normative evidence rules are in the stable
[testing strategy](testing-strategy.en.md) and its [Chinese source](testing-strategy.zh-CN.md).
Historical records under `docs/acceptance/` retain candidate-specific evidence and do not prove
later versions.

Automated checks are necessary but do not prove Obsidian runtime behavior. Complete this checklist
in a disposable acceptance Vault before publishing a release. Do not use a production Vault for
first acceptance.

## Test setup

- [ ] Build with `npm ci && npm run check`.
- [ ] Copy only `dist/main.js`, `dist/manifest.json`, and `dist/styles.css` into `.obsidian/plugins/heading-numerals/`.
- [ ] Hash-verify the copied files.
- [ ] Ensure no other heading-number plugin or CSS counter snippet is active.
- [ ] Record Obsidian version, OS, theme, and plugin version.

## Highest-value loop

- [ ] Click the ribbon icon and confirm it opens the current-note panel without changing the note or global settings.
- [ ] Confirm the panel names the active note and shows global, current-note override, and effective values.
- [ ] Set virtual display and concealment independently through Follow global / On / Off; re-open the panel and verify persistence and effective display.
- [ ] Choose a built-in and a custom scheme from the panel without typing an ID; Follow global must delete the scheme property.
- [ ] Enable note ignore, then restore all to Follow global; verify all plugin Properties are removed and unrelated Properties remain byte-for-byte equivalent.
- [ ] In Live Preview, show virtual numbers for an unnumbered note and confirm the file hash and mtime do not change.
- [ ] Switch to Reading View and confirm numbering continues correctly across rendered sections.
- [ ] Write numbers to the current note, inspect the preview, apply, then undo and redo once.
- [ ] Conceal the stored numbers, move the cursor into each heading, select across a prefix, copy, and use a Chinese IME.
- [ ] Enable virtual numbers and concealment together; each recognized stored prefix must be replaced by exactly one virtual number in Live Preview and Reading View.
- [ ] Reload and disable the plugin; confirm source text remains accessible and Reading View DOM decoration disappears.

## Captions and same-file references

- [ ] Verify `Figure:`, `Table:`, `Equation:`, and `Code:` each start at 1 and increment independently; `Listing:` remains unchanged.
- [ ] Verify captions without IDs are numbered and captions with inline or immediately following user-authored block IDs receive the same behavior.
- [ ] Confirm Live Preview and Reading View show `Figure 1:`-style labels while the Markdown bytes, mtime, and IDs remain unchanged.
- [ ] Verify `@[[#Heading]]`, `@[[#^block-id]]`, and both `|alias` forms retain native link navigation and add a number only when the target has a visible valid number.
- [ ] Verify ordinary `[[#...]]`, cross-file links, missing targets, duplicate headings/IDs, and unnumbered headings remain unchanged.
- [ ] Embed a numbered note into another note and confirm each file keeps independent caption counters and reference targets.
- [ ] Compose with an IME, reload, disable the plugin, and switch views; all replaced `@` markers and source syntax must remain recoverable and unchanged.

## Multi-pane and lifecycle

- [ ] Open different notes in two panes with different Properties view modes.
- [ ] Open a pop-out window and verify styling and independent view state.
- [ ] Edit a heading to another heading of the same character length; decorations must update.
- [ ] Toggle `heading-numerals-show-virtual` and `heading-numerals-conceal-stored` without changing file length; both independent states must update immediately.
- [ ] Scroll a note with at least 2,000 headings and record editing latency.

## Parser safety

- [ ] YAML, backtick/tilde code fences, HTML comments/blocks, Obsidian `%%` comments, blockquotes, lists, and Setext headings remain unchanged.
- [ ] `3.14`, `2.0`, `2026`, dates, and unit quantities remain visible and are not removed by high-confidence cleanup.
- [ ] Wiki links, aliases, bold text, inline code, Emoji, CRLF, trailing hashes, BOM, and final newline are preserved.
- [ ] Multi-prefix headings appear clearly in preview.
- [ ] Prefixes produced by an active custom scheme and an archived pre-edit/pre-delete revision are both found by template cleanup; unrelated manual numbering remains unchanged.

## Source markers

Source markers are disabled by default. Before enabling them for a release claim:

- [ ] Verify Outline and Search display.
- [ ] Copy heading text and inspect it in an external editor.
- [ ] Copy a heading link, reload Obsidian, and navigate it.
- [ ] Test Unicode normalization and a formatter round-trip.
- [ ] Test malformed and one-sided markers; they must fail closed.
- [ ] Run the strip-marker command and verify visible numbers remain.

## Exact-title exclusions

- [ ] Add an exact exclusion to a copied custom scheme and verify the current-note match preview.
- [ ] Verify a heading-only exclusion does not consume a number and routes descendants through each skipped-level strategy.
- [ ] Verify a whole-section exclusion skips its descendants and numbering resumes at the surrounding level.
- [ ] Verify Live Preview, Reading View, write, renumber, current-note commands, and batch preview share the same exclusions.
- [ ] Verify a confirmed old prefix is removed from an excluded title while an ambiguous manual prefix is preserved with a warning.
- [ ] Verify inline formatting, similar-but-not-exact titles, code fences, YAML, comments, and duplicate rules fail safely.

## Batch recovery

- [ ] Use a temporary folder with at least ten notes and preview write, remove, and renumber.
- [ ] Change one file after preview; the entire batch must cancel.
- [ ] Apply a batch, then restore it; every file must be byte-identical to its original.
- [ ] Independently edit one applied file; restore must cancel without changing any file.
- [ ] Simulate a mid-batch error and confirm completed files roll back or remain recoverable from the pending snapshot.
- [ ] Edit an already-written file while a later batch write fails; rollback must preserve that edit and retain recovery.
- [ ] Excluded folders are not read into the preview and are not modified.
- [ ] `data.json` contains settings only; recovery data is stored in `recovery.json`, and failed setting writes remain visibly retryable.

## Themes and platform

- [ ] Test the default theme and at least one third-party theme.
- [ ] Test Windows desktop and one additional desktop platform before claiming cross-platform support.
- [ ] Keep `isDesktopOnly: true` until a dated mobile runtime acceptance record exists under
  `docs/acceptance/`. Once mobile loading is enabled, preserve that platform baseline and continue
  recording emulator, physical-device, and release-specific evidence as separate claims.
