# Testing strategy

[中文规范源](testing-strategy.zh-CN.md)

<!-- section: authority -->
## Document authority

The Chinese document is the normative source for verification layers, gates, and evidence claims.
This file is its synchronized English translation. `ACCEPTANCE.md` is an executable checklist and
`docs/acceptance/` contains historical evidence; neither can weaken this strategy.

<!-- section: evidence-levels -->
## Evidence levels

1. **Source checks**: format, bilingual structure, lint, types, pure-logic and adapter tests.
2. **Candidate checks**: production bundle, manifest/version alignment, externals, offline runtime,
   and exact asset layout.
3. **Host acceptance**: real interaction in a named Obsidian version, OS, theme, and isolated vault.
4. **Device acceptance**: emulator and physical-device records remain separate.
5. **Public release**: remote tag, Release assets, byte comparison, and provenance; local builds do
   not prove this level.

Reports identify their evidence level and cannot infer a higher-level pass from a lower level.

<!-- section: automated-tests -->
## Automated tests

Core tests cover scanning, template compilation, formats, prefix recognition, exclusions, counters,
migration compatibility, and immutable change plans. Application tests cover virtual/conceal plans,
Properties parsing, note overrides, and conditional replacement. Adapter tests cover recovery data,
Reading View DOM behavior, and settings contracts. Broader prefix recognition requires
false-positive fixtures first.

Coverage thresholds are regression floors, not quality targets or host acceptance. New critical
branches need behavioral assertions even when aggregate coverage stays above threshold.

<!-- section: canonical-gate -->
## Canonical gate

Under repository-pinned Node.js `24.18.0` and npm `11.16.0`, run:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
```

The gate verifies runtime contract, real formatting, bilingual README structure, five stable
document pairs, lint, strict TypeScript, thresholded coverage, production bundle, and release-asset
contract. `release:check` adds version, tag, and clean-worktree checks.

<!-- section: host-acceptance -->
## Host acceptance

First runs use an isolated acceptance vault. At minimum, verify current-note controls, independent
display/concealment, Live Preview, Reading View, previewed writes and undo, source accessibility,
plugin-disable cleanup, same-length edits, Properties persistence, and link-risk messaging. Batch
work also verifies stale previews, concurrent conflicts, mid-run failure, recovery, and exclusions.

IME, mobile, pop-out windows, third-party themes, and long-document latency require real host
environments; automated DOM tests cannot replace them. Detailed steps remain in the
[runtime checklist](ACCEPTANCE.md).

<!-- section: records -->
## Acceptance records

Each record identifies candidate commit, asset SHA-256, plugin/Obsidian versions, OS or device,
vault type, theme, automated gate, actual passed cases, known limitations, date, and executor.
Records are append-only historical facts. Later code or documentation cannot reinterpret an old
candidate as acceptance of a new one.

<!-- section: release-decision -->
## Release decision

Claim only the scope supported by the target version's canonical gate, candidate contract, and
required host matrix. If macOS, Linux, or physical-mobile records are missing, state that limitation
instead of saying “cross-platform verified.” See the [release policy](release.en.md) for publication
and remote-asset verification.
